# Azure_Data_Factory

In this mini-project, you will deploy an End-to-End Azure ELT solution. You will use Azure
Data Factory and Mapping Dataflows to perform Extract Load Transform (ELT) using Azure
Blob storage and Azure SQL DB. You will also use Azure DevOps repositories to perform
source control over ADF pipelines. Optionally, you may use Azure DevOps pipelines to
deploy across multiple environments including Dev, Test, and Production.
